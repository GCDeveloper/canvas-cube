# canvas-cube
An Experiment in creating 3D objects with JavaScript and canvas.

This was the first truly 3D object I coded purely with JavaScript and canvas.

The cube consists of 8 verticies consisting of an x,y,z position, and 12 edges which are the connections between verticies, which are used to render the object.

Rotation and object positioning can be interacted with using mouse-move and mouse-down.
